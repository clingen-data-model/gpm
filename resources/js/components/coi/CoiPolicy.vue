        <h2>Conflict of Interest Policy</h2>
        Please review the ClinGen Conflict of Interest (COI) and use of ClinGen curation data policies below.

        <h3>Conflict of Interest:</h3>
        The purpose of the COI declaration is to ensure that any COIs that could be perceived to influence the decision-making of the working group, expert panel, or committee (hereafter referred to as “ClinGen group”) are appropriately recorded and managed and to make sure that any overlapping projects are communicated to aid in managing any overlap. By submitting this attestation you are acknowledging and agreeing to abide by the ClinGen COI policies.

        Please note that each ClinGen group will request the declaration of relevant COI disclosures separately; you will receive multiple attestations if you belong to multiple ClinGen groups. This information will be posted publicly to the ClinGen website.


        <h3>Types of COI</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Academic</strong>: An individual may be perceived to have an “academic” conflict of interest when they have participated in scientific discoveries or contributed to the general body of knowledge regarding a particular gene, variant, condition-related therapies/drugs/devices, software, framework development, processes or other discoveries related to their ClinGen efforts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Financial</strong>: An individual may be perceived to have a “financial” conflict of interest if they have a financial relationship (e.g., employment, participation on an advisory board, patents, intellectual property ownership, grants or paid consultancies) with a commercial entity that provides genetic testing services and where there could be a vested interest in a particular gene, or variant, condition-related therapies/drugs/devices, software, framework development, processes or other discoveries related to their ClinGen efforts.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Management of COI</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Individuals with academic or financial COI may serve on a ClinGen group and are welcome to voice their opinions.
            </li>
            <li>
                This provision is more important when there are competing activities (e.g., limited data informing a curation and it was primarily provided by that individual or the individual’s lab group).
            </li>
            <li>
                If there is general consensus there is no need to remove oneself; however, if there is a difference of opinion, there should be a recusal.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Competing activities:</h3>
        ClinGen group members are expected to be open with their group about other pre-existing activities or new initiatives that coincide with their involvement in ClinGen and/or potentially overlap with the scope of their ClinGen work. The member(s) and the group chairs should come to an agreement on how to manage the overlap.
