            Variant Curation Expert Panels are expected to keep their variant interpretations up-to-date and to expedite the re-review of variants that have a conflicting assertion submitted to ClinVar after the Expert Panel submission (guidelines for recuration timeline provide in the VCEP protocol: https://clinicalgenome.org/docs/clingen-variant-curation-expert-panel-vcep-protocol/). . Please answer the following question concerning recuration:
